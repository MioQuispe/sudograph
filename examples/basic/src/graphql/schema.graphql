# TODO come up with a really awesome example project to use...file storage app?
# TODO the app should need complex relational data structures, but not much authorization
# TODO perhaps file storage, or email even?
# TODO something with public data, where auth is on a per-person basis
# TODO and perhaps something that others are not making...or at least that would actually be useful
# TODO Ideas:
# crates.io
# google drive type of thing
# internet archive type of thing
# github type of thing
# blog? blog post thing?
